# Synthetic Datasets for Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository provides synthetic datasets designed for **Machine Learning (ML)** research and development. The datasets include:
1. **3D Tumor Structures**: Simulated medical imaging data for tasks like **tumor detection**, **segmentation**, and **classification**.
2. **Synthetic Motion Videos**: Datasets simulating **cell-like motion** and **vehicle-like trajectories** for tasks like **object tracking**, **motion prediction**, and **anomaly detection**.

These datasets aim to facilitate ML experiments in **healthcare**, **bioinformatics**, and **autonomous systems**, offering realistic yet computationally generated examples.

  - Tumor segmentation and classification.
  - Training ML models for 3D medical image analysis.
  - Testing the robustness of quantum or classical imaging algorithms.
- **Key Features**:
  - Customizable tumor properties.
  - Smooth, realistic background noise resembling tissue.
  - Generates slices for 2D and volumetric data.

### 2. **Synthetic Motion Videos**
- **Description**:
  - Simulated 2D/3D videos mimicking the motion of:
    - Biological cells (random, diffusion-like patterns).
    - Vehicles (straight-line, curved, or anomaly-inducing trajectories).
- **Applications**:
  - Object detection and tracking.
  - Motion prediction and anomaly detection.
  - Temporal ML tasks like RNN or transformer-based models.
- **Key Features**:
  - Variety of motion patterns (random walk, linear, oscillatory).
  - Adjustable resolution, object count, and noise levels.
  - Easily scalable for different use cases.
